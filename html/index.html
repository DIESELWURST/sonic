    <h2>About Sonic:</h2>
    <p>Sonic the Hedgehog (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ Sonikku za Hejjihoggu?,
         born 23 June is the titular main protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and Sega's mascot.
          He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog born with the ability to run faster than the speed of sound, hence his name, and possesses lightning-fast reflexes to match his speed. As his species implies, Sonic can also roll up into a concussive ball, primarily to attack enemies.</p>
